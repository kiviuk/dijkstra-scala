# A graph path discovery coding task.

Please implement the function `ShortestPaths.kShortestPaths` which discovers the first `k` 
shortest paths from a start node to an end node in an undirected graph with strictly positive edge
lengths. The function is marked with "TODO" in the source file and carries a more precise 
specification of the expected behavior in its Scaladoc.

Please write the implementation with the same quality standards in mind which you would also use
for production code. The evaluation criteria are functional correctness, readability/maintainability
and computational complexity (in decreasing order of importance). Please submit everything you have 
written, including documentation and tests.

Your implementation of `ShortestPaths.k_shortest_paths` should 
* use Scala 2.13 as preinstalled in the given `build.sbt`,
* build with `sbt` and
* use no external dependency except for the standard library and a testing framework of your choice.
